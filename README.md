### Hi there, I'm 𝐌𝐃. 𝐙𝐈𝐀𝐔𝐋 𝐇𝐀𝐒𝐀𝐍 👋

## 🅰🅱🅾🆄 🆃

A growing mind dedicated to HealthTech.

I am pursuing a BSc in Biomedical Engineering from CUET, where getting a foundation in the field of Healthcare and Life Science. I am also involved in the CSE Fundamentals program on Phitron, which enables me to develop my skills in Computer Science. In addition to my studies, I am honing my skills as an analyst at   
Tork Inc, where I am gaining real-world experience and sharpening my analytical abilities.

In my Third year of undergraduate, I will break into Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. To achieve my target I have set two big targets for myself:
• To get a Data Science role
• To become a Kaggle Competition expert 

In my fourth and final year of undergraduate studies, I am eager to explore the world of Health Informatics - the exciting domain where healthcare meets data   
science. With a passion for unlocking insights from complex data sets, I will prepare to be a next-generation data specialist. While my primary focus is on   
health and life sciences, I am eager to become a versatile data specialist with the ability to work with any type of data.

I am committed to achieving my goals and becoming an impactful person in HealthTech. While the road ahead may be challenging, I am driven by my passion for making   
a meaningful impact on people's lives. I believe that with hard work, dedication, and a curious mind, I can achieve my dreams and create a better world for all.
